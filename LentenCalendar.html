            <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-500/80 mt-4 uppercase text-xs tracking-wider">Lenten Weekdays</h4>
            <p>"The readings from the Gospels and the Old Testament were selected because they are related to each other. They treat various themes of the Lenten catechesis that are suited to the spiritual significance of this season."</p>
            
            <p>Beginning with Monday of the Fourth Week of Lent, there is a semicontinuous reading of the Gospel of John, made up of texts that correspond more closely to the themes proper to Lent.</p>
            <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 italic text-right mb-4">(Lectionary for Mass, "Introduction," chap. 5, par. 98)</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-500/80 mt-4 uppercase text-xs tracking-wider">The Sunday Gospels</h4>
            <p>The Gospel readings are arranged as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li>The first and second Sundays maintain the accounts of the Temptation and Transfiguration of the Lord, with readings, however, from all three Synoptics.</li>
                <li>On the next three Sundays, the Gospels about the Samaritan woman, the man born blind, and the raising of Lazarus have been restored in Year A. Because these Gospels are of major importance in regard to Christian initiation, they may also be read in Year B and Year C, especially in places where there are catechumens.</li>
                <li>Other texts, however, are provided for Year B and Year C: for Year B, a text from John about Christ's coming glorification through his Cross and Resurrection, and for Year C, a text from Luke about conversion.</li>
                <li>On Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion the texts for the procession are selections from the Synoptic Gospels concerning the Lord's solemn entry into Jerusalem. For the Mass the reading is the account of the Lord's Passion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-500/80 mt-4 uppercase text-xs tracking-wider">Old Testament & Epistles</h4>
            <p>The Old Testament readings are about the history of salvation, which is one of the themes proper to the catechesis of Lent. The series of texts for each Year presents the main elements of salvation history from its beginning until the promise of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>The readings from the Letters of the Apostles have been selected to fit the Gospel and the Old Testament readings and, to the extent possible, to provide a connection between them.</p>
            <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 italic text-right mb-4">(Lectionary for Mass, "Introduction," chap. 5, par. 97)</p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-yellow-500/80 mt-4 uppercase text-xs tracking-wider">Holy Week & The Triduum</h4>
            <p>In the first days of Holy Week the readings are about the mystery of Christ's passion.</p>
            
            <p class="font-bold text-yellow-200 mt-2">The Sacred Easter Triduum (excerpt):</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
                <li>On Holy Thursday at the evening Mass the remembrance of the meal preceding the Exodus casts its own special light because of the Christ's example in washing the feet of his disciples and Paul's account of the institution of the Christian Passover in the Eucharist.</li>
                <li>On Good Friday the liturgical service has as its center John's narrative of the Passion of him who was proclaimed in Isaiah as the Servant of the Lord and who became the one High Priest by offering himself to the Father.</li>
            </ul>
